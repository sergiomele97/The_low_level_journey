# Workspace Rules: The Low Level Journey

## 🧬 Principles
- **No Magic:** Avoid unnecessary abstractions. Every concept (GDT, A20, Real Mode) must be explained and implemented manually.
- **Documentation First:** All learning, errors, and decisions must be documented in `docs/` in chronological order.
- **Index Sync:** Every time a new chapter is added or modified, ensure [`docs/_Index.md`](file:///home/sergio/work/antigravity/The_low_level_journey/docs/_Index.md) is updated.
- **Vibecoding:** Keep explanations simple, clear, and attractive. Focus on the *why* and the learning process, not just the code.

## 🗺 Roadmap Reference
Always refer to [`docs/_Index.md`](file:///home/sergio/work/antigravity/The_low_level_journey/docs/_Index.md) for the current status and future steps.

## ✅ Goal
Build an x86 Operating System from scratch.
