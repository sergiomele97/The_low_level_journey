# 🚀 The Low-Level Journey

Personal exploration into architecture and minimalist development.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **[src/](file:///home/sergio/work/antigravity/The_low_level_journey/src)**: RISC-V 32-bit assembly projects from scratch (no high-level abstractions).
- **[dotfiles/](file:///home/sergio/work/antigravity/The_low_level_journey/dotfiles)**: Custom dev environment based on Tmux, Neovim, and Yazi.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

- **RISC-V**: Go to `src/` and run `make run`.
- **Environment**: Go to `dotfiles/` and run `./install.sh`.
